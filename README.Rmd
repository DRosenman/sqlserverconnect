# mssqlr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`mssqlr` provides a minimal, user-friendly interface for connecting to Microsoft SQL Server from R.  
It wraps `DBI`, `odbc`, and `pool` with a small set of clean, consistent helpers:

- `db_connect()` – establish a DBI (default) or pooled connection  
- `db_disconnect()` – safely close DBI or pooled connections  

Although most users will interact only with these two functions, the package also includes:

- `db_connection_args()` – constructs a standardized list of connection arguments used internally by `db_connect()`

The goal is to offer a lightweight, expressive API without the boilerplate typically required for SQL Server connections.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **mssqlr** from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("drosenman/mssqlr")
```

## Quick Start: Connect, Query, Disconnect

Here’s a short example demonstrating how to connect, query, and disconnect:

```r
library(mssqlr)

# Connect to a SQL Server database
conn <- db_connect(
  server   = "localhost",
  database = "master"
)

# ... use the connection ...
DBI::dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM sys.tables")

# Disconnect when finished
db_disconnect(conn)
```

## Example: Pooled Connections

`db_connect()` supports both DBI and pooled connections. Set `pool = TRUE` to use a pool, or leave it as the default (`FALSE`) for a regular DBI connection.

```
library(mssqlr)
library(DBI)

# Create a pooled connection
pool <- db_connect(
  server   = "localhost",
  database = "master",
  pool     = TRUE
)

# Use the pool like any DBI connection
DBI::dbGetQuery(pool, "SELECT name FROM sys.databases")

# When finished, close the pool
db_disconnect(pool)
```

## DBI vs Pool: When to Use Which?

To use the DBI package for connections, keep `pool = FALSE` (the default setting). To use the pool package for connections, set `pool = TRUE`.

| Feature / Use Case        | db_connect(pool = FALSE)        | db_connect(pool = TRUE)               |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Interactive scripts       | Simple and direct                | Not usually necessary                  |
| Long-running processes    | May time out                     | Manages idle connections automatically |
| Shiny apps                | Risk of too many connections     | Recommended best practice              |
| Parallel workloads        | Each worker opens its own conn   | Pool reuses connections                |
| Cleanup                   | db_disconnect()                  | db_disconnect() (works for pools too)  |


## Why use mssqlr?

- Minimal surface area  
- Clear, explicit arguments  
- Works with both DBI and pooled connections  
- No unnecessary abstractions  

If you frequently connect to SQL Server from R, this package keeps your workflow clean and consistent.
